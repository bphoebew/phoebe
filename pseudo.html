    <h1 class = "proTitle">Why I Did This? </h1>
    <h1 class = "proSub">I know many friends that are catfished. Since they were only teens, they didn't know the effects of talking to strangers online. They just wanted to escape from the world and have fun. Sometimes its not just fun though. I wanted to help others such as my friends and help them be caution when online. Therefore, my friend and I created a game where you will be placed in scenarios talking to possible catfishers</h1>
