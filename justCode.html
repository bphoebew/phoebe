    <h1 class = "proSub">Seeing only a few amount of girls in my AP Computer Science Principles class, I was unsuprised. However, I quickly found out that many girls didn't want to take the class because they felt pressured that it was hard and too many stereotypes were put on girls in CS. I wanted to create a unique & supportive sisterhood for girls at WR who want to pursue Computer Science </h1>
